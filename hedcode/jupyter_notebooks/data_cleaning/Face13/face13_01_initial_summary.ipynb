    "## Initial summary of event files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**: face13\n",
    "\n",
    "This script does a preliminary summary of the contents of the events files.\n",
    "The summary includes printing out the column names of each event file so\n",
    "that they can be manually checked for differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script assumes that the data is in BIDS format and that each BIDS events\n",
    "file of the form `_events.tsv` has a corresponding events file with\n",
    "suffix `_events_temp.tsv` that was previously dumped from the `EEG.set` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare the events coming from the BIDS events files and those\n",
    "from the EEG.set files, the script creates dictionaries of `key` to full path\n",
    "for each type of file.  The `key` is of the form `sub-xxx_run-y` which\n",
    "uniquely specify each event file in the dataset. If a dataset contains\n",
    "multiple sessions for each subject, the `key` should include additional\n",
    "parts of the file name to uniquely specify each subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keys are specified by a `name_indices` tuple which consists of the\n",
    "pieces of the file name to include. Here pieces are separated by the\n",
    "underbar character.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a file name `sub-001_ses-3_task-target_run-01_events.tsv`,\n",
    "the tuple (0, 2) gives a key of `sub-001_task-target`,\n",
    "while the tuple (0, 3) gives a key of `sub-001_run-01`.\n",
    "The use of dictionaries of file names with such keys makes it\n",
    "easier to associate related files in the BIDS naming structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup requires the setting of the following variables for your dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable | Purpose |\n",
    "| -------- | ------- |\n",
    "| bids_root_path | Full path to root directory of dataset.|\n",
    "| exclude_dirs | List of directories to exclude when constructing file lists. |\n",
    "| entities  | Tuple of entity names used to construct a unique keys representing filenames. <br>(See [Dictionaries of filenames](https://hed-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/HedInPython.html#dictionaries-of-filenames-anchor) for examples of how to choose the key.)||\n",
    "| skip_columns  |  List of column names in the `events.tsv` files to skip in the analysis. |"
